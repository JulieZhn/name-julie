# Someone said Julie is an outdated name. Is it? 🥹🤨😧
### When I googled my name, I found that it's not used as much nowadays; people prefer "Julia" or "Juliette" for naming babies.

From data analysis, here are **my findings**:

- “Julie” was really popular in the 60s and 70s but then faded away.
- As I was born in 2001, around the 2000s, people loved to name their daughter “Emily” and their son “Jacob.” Data shows that there were 223,734 Emilys and 273,992 Jacobs at that time.
- “Jessica” was leading the ranking with 303,118 girls named it in the 1990s in the U.S. Michael was the top 1 name favored by American parents for their boys, with 462,390 babies given that time.

**Data Analysis**:
I created several tabels with the columns I want from the big datasets, and used **Pandas** to read the CSV files. Then I used **ggplot** to create basic charts and visualizations, save them into pdf, and edit the charts in **Adobe Illustrator**. Employing the technique of **ai2html**, I made these charts responsive to the size of screen and inserted them into HTML.

**New Learnings**:
I exercised my skills of using ggplot and editing charts in AI, and first time tried ai2html.
